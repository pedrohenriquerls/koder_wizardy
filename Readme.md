It is an inspired zelda game and strategy games with mechanical shift where to solve specific tasks or to win Their battles, the player will have to write code to solve the problem posed.
In this game we try make a sandbox to player try execute any javascript with any objects in the game.
example:
  In the first battle we try teach to players about objects and your attrs, you can defeat the enemys with the public attr life, with a simple attribution like: enemy.life = -1 or enemy.life = 0
